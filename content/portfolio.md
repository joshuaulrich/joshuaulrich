### Specialties

* Decomposing and understanding complex systems, whether they are software,
  hardware, or business processes.
* Programming in R, C, C++, C#, Java, SQL, with the ability to easily
  understand most other programming languages.
* Statistical analysis, simulation, and optimization.
* Process automation and integration across applications.

### R Packages

I've written several [R](https://www.r-project.org) packages, and contribute to many more. I currently maintain quantmod, TTR, xts, IBrokers, microbenchmark, and pack on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org).

* [quantmod](https://cran.r-project.org/package=quantmod) - tools for importing, manipulating, and visualizing financial market data (co-authored with [Jeff Ryan](http://lemnica.com/), maintainer)
* [TTR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=TTR) - a suite of technical analysis functions (author, maintainer)
* [xts](https://cran.r-project.org/package=xts) - a time-based data class that integrates all of the current time-series classes (co-authored with [Jeff Ryan](http://lemnica.com/), maintainer)
* [zoo](https://cran.r-project.org/package=zoo) - a data class for ordered indexed observations, particularly for irregular time series (contributor)
* [IBrokers](https://cran.r-project.org/package=IBrokers) - a pure R implementation of the [Interactive Brokers](https://interactivebrokers.com) Trader Workstation API (co-authored with Jeff Ryan, maintainer)
* [blotter](https://github.com/braverock/blotter) - portfolio and account transaction infrastructure for trading systems and simulation (contributor)
* [quantstrat](https://github.com/braverock/quantstrat) - quantitative trading strategy modeling framework (co-author)
* [PerformanceAnalytics](https://github.com/braverock/PerformanceAnalytics) - econometric functions for performance and risk analysis of financial instruments or portfolios (contributor)
* [DEoptim](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DEoptim) - global optimizer via differential evolution (co-author)
* [microbenchmark](https://cran.r-project.org/package=microbenchmark) - accurately measure and compare the execution time of R expressions (maintainer)
* [pack](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pack) - convert binary to/from formats other programs and machines can understand (author, maintainer)
* [lspm](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/lspm) - an R-based implementation of [Ralph Vince's](http://www.ralphvince.com/) [Leverage Space Portfolio Model](https://amzn.to/2Y2Raaj) (co-authored with Soren Macbeth, maintainer)
* [opentick](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/opentick) - an R API to the opentick databases (author, defunct)

### Code

* I created the first [Dockerfile for rchk](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/rchk-docker) (a set of tools that look for memory errors in C source code of R packages). My Dockerfil was the basis for [rhub's](https://builder.r-hub.io/) version in [ubuntu-rchk](https://github.com/r-hub/rhub-linux-builders/commit/11ca3852ddce5d66627b6a3f88259681f81ea97e#diff-ab71b71c918ecd93559c25f1a3161344)
* [npri.c](https://gist.github.com/joshuaulrich/1271633) - An adaptation of code given in a [MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302371.aspx) that provides the **i'th** permutation of **n** things taken **r** at a time. Unlike the MSDN article, this code allows for **n** != **r**.
