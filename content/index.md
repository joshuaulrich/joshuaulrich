My formal education is in economics. My programming skills and computer knowledge are self-taught. I have an uncanny ability to find answers to questions outside my immediate expertise. This allows me to be more than another productive member of a team; it enables me to increase the productivity of all my co-workers by finding better ways to complete every project.

I have a deep love of learning and I enjoy building / fixing all kinds of things -- software, computer hardware, engines, etc.
